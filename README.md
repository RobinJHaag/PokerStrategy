# PokerStrategy
This will be a Reinforcment learning Project, looking to leverage the RL strengths at games to develop a working poker
strategy for Cash Games and Tournament play.


The first step will be to develop a working poker environment, and then to develop a working poker strategy.

I wanna look at Q-Learning specifically.

The goal will be to use rewards to find a good strategy for your goals. If you wanna play cash games and minimise the
risk taken. Or you can maximise the hourly EV by taking more risks. If you wanna play tournaments you can maximise the 
reward for staying alive to maximise the placement. 

Those are all just ideas without any real research behind them yet. Research will happen as i go along but because I 
don't wanna write a paper it will stay with me.
